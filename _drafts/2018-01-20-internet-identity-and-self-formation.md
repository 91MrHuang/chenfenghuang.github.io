summary:    Hooked into dozens of digital systems, the 21st person is becoming increasingly fragmented, perverted, exploited, and de-humanized.

From your Facebook profile we can derive your sexuality, age, and political views [^1]. This means that in a very real sense certain salient aspects of yourself, and thus part of your identity, are replicated across Facebook datacenters. This is form a self-distribution, happening in this case without particular acknowledge or perhaps consent, and it is the general idea of the fragmented, distributed digital identity, this *projection* of ourselves into internet software systems, that is to be explored below. Obviously Facebook isn't the only one in on the game. Tinder knows* your romantic preferences, Pornhub your fetishes, Uber Eats your dietary needs, and The New York Times your worldly concerns. All this is rather uncontroversially being used to build your 'Daily Me'[^2]; various fragments of your identity (ie. of your *self*) extracted, stored, and instrumented into delivering you 'value', into enabled your preferences. To emphasise what's happening to the identity over some abstract notion of 'personal data' I think allows for better inspection of the perversity of this current practice. Currently, the self is 'managed' online by software systems, those systems management theory is broken. Broken as it is, it has so far proved to be such an effective driver of ad-revenue that without realising it the theory will be mastered and it's apotheosis will be a hugely confused, inefficient subversion of human value. Fortunately there's always another way, and despite current problems continued work like such done by [Time Well Spent]() into intelligent systems of online self-formation and self-management could see truly amazing improvements in our connected systems ability to positively augment ourselves and our lives.

^ rewrite that shit

> * the don't really know, but more on that below

The main drivers of identity fragment extraction are of course companies, and they've been doing it since the days you filled out your preferred breakfast & newspaper order at a hotel. This is a perfectly reasonable thing do, and in the past it was a perfectly appropriate method of extraction (how else are they going to get that information into their filing cabinet?), but it's not enough of an insight to facilitate targeted propoganda on Twitter [^3]. Again, there is nothing fundamentally new about this kind of self-externalisation and self-distribution (in this case of preferences), but it is *how* it is being doing in the context of the modern, writeable internet that is has become the beginnings of a great mess.

Besides these manual, pass√© methods of information extraction from people, the explosion of the internet has brought feasibility to massively-scaled *passive* and convert methods of extraction. The passive bit is partly great, avoid the UX anti-pattern of tedious, repetitive user 'onboarding' and feedback mechanisms. It's partly bad, because passive information-sharing by users is a highly limited thing, but more on that later. The covert nature of the extraction is not really at all great, and arising from this self-extraction activity conducted by companies is so often adversarial to ourselves and also sometimes exploitative. It's adversarial, for example, when the information gathering process serves to learn what kind of content will keep you on site, whether you really want to be or not. It's adversarial, when the process seeks to discover your individual *Willingness To Pay*, which is the maximum price you'll pay, when you yourself want the *minimum price they'll sell for*. It's adversarial, when what the system knows about you can be sold to the highest paying propagandist, or the highest paying snake-oil salesman.

People wouldn't participate in this disadvantageuous gifting of valuable personal insight if they could help it, and so it happens silently and almost totally without cooperation between user and system. Without this cooperation what results is millions of unfriendly (and as yet thankfully primitive)[Black Mirror-Type Cookies]().
