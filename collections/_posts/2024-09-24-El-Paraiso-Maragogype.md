The El Paraiso Maragogype beans, renowned for their tropical fruity notes, hail from the innovative El Paraiso Estate ðŸ¥‡. Both dry and wet aromas are intensely fragrant, leaving an unforgettable first impression.

Dayglow's roast, while ambitious, may have slightly overstepped, introducing a hint of bitterness. This could also be inherent to the giant Maragogipe variety. As a first-time taster, I suggest tweaking the brew to reduce extraction.

Apax Lab's natural processing and specialized water blend elevate the coffee's essence-like profile. However, whether should I categorize Koji Amazake Method as a true natural process remains uncertain.
