> Computing is pop culture. [...] Pop culture holds a disdain for history. Pop culture is all about identity and feeling like you're participating, It has nothing to do with cooperation, the past or the future‚Äîit's living in the present. I think the same is true of most people who write code for money. They have no idea where [their culture came from]. -¬†Alan Kay

> We have ignored cultural literacy in thinking about education We ignore the air we breathe until it is thin or foul. Cultural literacy is the oxygen of social intercourse. - E. D. Hirsch Jr

To be culturally literate is to possess the basic information needed to thrive in the modern world. Computing cultural literacy is an overlapping but largely separate possession of basic information needed to thrive in today‚Äôs world of software and computing. Or is it needed at all? Did Jeff Bezos, sitting somewhere in Seattle in 1993 and watching internet traffic grow 230,000% need to know about UNIX, the Morris Worm, or Ada Lovelace in order to start [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com) and become maybe the most successful software entrepreneur of all time? If one were to set down these _things to know_, would most programmers know them? Would you?

This idea of cultural literacy is taken directly from E. D. Hirsch Junior‚Äôs 1987 book _Cultural Literacy_. Hirsch Jr, a renowned education reformer, wanted the public to buy into great claims about knowledge-based literacy and the democratic, nation-building power of shared ideas. He lost the debate and his country‚Äôs institutions went other ways. In computing however, the debate has never been had. The one shot fired that is known to me comes from Alan Kay and is quoted above. He said that in a 2012 interview, and while he was clearly rankled, no one else cared to fight about it. Perhaps this field is too young, and does not yet have time for intro- and retro- spections.

Pop culture may have a disdain for the past, but coders won‚Äôt express a proud, rebuffing ‚Äúwe ain‚Äôt got no history‚Äù. Programmers tend to approach questions of providence and prior art as not so much unimportant but unnecessary. Come across people in the street tearing money out of a clear blue sky, and ask them where it came from. You‚Äôll feel as a software historian may do, interrupting a party and asking if not for answers at least for someone to please take some notes.

But I have found that I‚Äôm on Kay‚Äôs side; there‚Äôs just so much back there, in the past. There‚Äôs [VARIOUS INTERESTING THINGS]

, and of course, people‚Äîa lot of people takingacid and soldering tools of enlightment, Turing award winners sitting in alone in college offices writing tomes all come to love and never read; Turing, who you‚Äôll know made an eponymous machine and an AI test and was gay, but that‚Äôs not enough to know; couples spending nights at the Microsoft office, one at a keyboard one in a cot beside; people still _right_ _here_, in old file systems billions still use commenting things like "Error, skip block and hope for the best.‚Äù

Advancing cultural literacy is not revanchist. It does not want a rvtvrn to the old days when the term ‚Äúsoftware‚Äù sounded funny and it‚Äôs not a homework assignment. Let‚Äôs even concede that no one really _needs_ to know this stuff. But we should want to, because it‚Äôs just more fun, and with the knowledge we‚Äôll do better work together. So‚Äî

## ‚Ä¶ 500 essential names, dates, and concepts

Following the the lead of the original book, here‚Äôs an attempt at a list of essential names, phrases, dates, and concepts in the computing and software community. E. D. Hirsch Junior‚Äôs list was an absurd 5,000 items; here I bother with only 500.

As with the original list, ‚Äúknowing‚Äù something implies familiarity but not expertise.

The original list was also made collaboratively, and so is this one! The culture always moves, thinking left-to-right, at the right we have what‚Äôs slipping out of view and at the left is what is entering the core but remains fringe. You can indicate `left` when you find something to be ‚Äòtoo left‚Äô, that is, exiting our culture into the past. Indicate `right` for the opposite, when something is ‚Äòtoo right‚Äô, or too new. Undo with <kbd>‚åò</kbd>+<kbd>z</kbd>, and submit suggestions with the button at the bottom.
