This website is already peppered with book-related functionality, but I added ever more! Check out ...

## The set

**Below are the covers, titles, authors, and ratings of the <code>??</code> books I read this year.** The same info is shown at my [failed Goodreads reading challenge](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11636-2022-reading-challenge).

<hr>

I've set my 2023 reading goal [at 30 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88184044-jonathon-belotti), down from the failed 2022 goal of 40.
I'm only four months into living in a new city and doing a challenging job in a small startup, and expect that the number of times I feel like sitting
down for a few hours to work through a book will be still significantly lower than 2020 and 2021.

As to which books and authors will comprise the thirty or so that are read in 2023, they'll be drawn from the collection I've somewhat quickly accumulated in NYC:
_Democracy In Chains_, _Gilead_, Walter Benjamin, ED Hirsch Jr, Nicholas Nassim Taleb, Harlan Ellison, Daniel Yergin. So much to read, too little time.

.grow-me:hover {
