Until a few years ago, I didnâ€™t spend much time reading. 
Today, I spend a few hours every week reading, amounting to somewhere between 30 a year. 
My reading habit has evolved significantly over the past couple of years and surely will continue to.
In this post, I document my approach to reading.
