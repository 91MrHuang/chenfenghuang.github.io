I am a Software Engineering student at [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in Melbourne. I've previously interned with [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) on their [Answer Bot](https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/) product, and at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) as an application developer in their reliability/monitoring team. I'm currently shopping around for graduate software engineering positions starting after November 2018.

I'm currently doing a lot of work building developer communities around my University. I'll chase any opportunity to improve collaboration and outreach in the tech. industry.

My main areas of interest are in NLP, Knowledge Bases, and Computational Dialectics.
