### About Me - May 2019 Edition

I'm a Backend Software Engineer @ [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) in their Data Engineering team. 
I'm still quite interested in NLP, Knowledge Bases, and Computational Dialectics, but now regularly find myself
exploring the world of the [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) build system. 

Major surgery on my right leg has had me off my feet for six months now, so I've spent most of my free time stationary, either
[reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/88184044-jonathon-belotti) or coding ðŸ™‚. 


### About Me - Jan 2018 Edition

I am a Software Engineering student at [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in Melbourne. I've previously interned with [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) on their [Answer Bot](https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/) product, and at [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com) as an application developer in their reliability/monitoring team.
I'm currently shopping around for graduate software engineering positions starting after November 2018.

I'm currently also doing a lot of work building developer communities around my University. I'll chase any opportunity to improve collaboration and outreach in the tech. industry.

My main areas of interest are in NLP, Knowledge Bases, and Computational Dialectics.
